# Web Infrastructure Design

This project contains diagrams and explanations of various web infrastructure designs, ranging from simple to complex architectures.

## Project Structure

- [0-simple_web_stack](0-simple_web_stack) - A simple web infrastructure design with a single server setup
- [1-distributed_web_infrastructure](1-distributed_web_infrastructure) - A distributed web infrastructure with load balancing
- [2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure](2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure) - A secured, encrypted and monitored web infrastructure
- [3-scale_up](3-scale_up) - An infrastructure designed to scale efficiently

## Designs
